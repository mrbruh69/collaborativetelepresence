		<h1>Impact on Education</h1>
		<p>
		With the use of <b>collaborative telepresence</b>, there will be no need for students and teachers to meet within the same room. Students may even have 
		the option to be in an entirely different country from the their classmates and teachers and still receive the same learning experience as if they were 
		in the traditional classroom.
