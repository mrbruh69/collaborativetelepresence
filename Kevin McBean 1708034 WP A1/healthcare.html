		<h1>Impact on Healthcare</h1>
		<p>
		With the use of <b>collaborative telepresence</b>, the goal is for doctors to be able to perform complex and detailed surgical operations on patients in a completely different location
		from which they are stationed. This will help to preserve the lives of many in critical conditions, who in an alternate situation, would not be able to receive the proper treatment due to 
		time constraints for a professional to physically travel to them.
