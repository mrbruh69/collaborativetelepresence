		<h1><strong>Negative Connotations of Collaborative Telepresence<strong></h1>
		<p>
		When people consider the introduction of Collaborative Telepresence into society, they may ponder upon the various negative effects it may have. 
		<br>
		<br>
		Some of these negative connotations associated with Collaborative Telepresence are: 
		</p>
		<br>
		<h2><strong>Less Real-world Interaction<strong></h2>
		<p>
		Due to increased usage and reliance on virtual communications and interactions, there will be less need for humans to meet up in person and engage in physical activities when they 
		have the ability to partake a similar experience at home.
		</P>
		<br>
		<h2><strong>Not As Precise as Real Life</strong></h2>
		<p>
		Development of technology enabling <b>Collaborative Telepresence</b> is extremely complicated as it requires that many different subtle inputs and outputs are processed in order to 
		create an accurate . For real life interactions, humans use detailed stimuli in order to decide on an appropriate reaction. Therefore, it will be believed that there is very little 
		chance of creating software that will allow virtual interactions to be as precise as that in real life.
