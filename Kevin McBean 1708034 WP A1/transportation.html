		<h1>Impact on Transportation</h1>
		<p>
		With the use of <b>collaborative telepresence</b>, roads will be used a lot less frequently because there would be more opportunities for people to do their jobs from home and also persons 
		would not need to travel to visit loved ones as often making traffic on the roadways less common. This may have a negative impact on the public transportation sector.
